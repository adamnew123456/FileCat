This is an attempt at an app to transfer files between an Android devices and
computers without having to configure a separate FTP server.

It includes:
  - the Android app (compile by running `ant clean && ant debug` and getting the APK onto the device)
  - the utility (runs on any system with Java installed - currently, only a Tcl GUI exists, but it can
                 run from the commandline - see below).

It is able to transfer files from:
  - Android device <-> Android device
  - computer <-> Android device
  - computer <-> computer

========== Usage ==========

Using the program is simple on two Android devices:
  1. Get onto the device which is to __recieve__ the file. Choose a port number (2000-60000),
     and an output file. Press "Recieve File" - the app should freeze while waiting
     for data.

  2. Then, go onto the device which is to __send__ the file. Enter the IP address
     of the first device, the port chosen earlier, and the file to send.
     Press "Send File" - this device should appear to freeze. When it is done sending
     the data (the button is no longer hilighted), the file is loaded on the first device.

Similarly, to go PC -> Android:
  1. Repeat step 1 above.

  2. Open the command line, go to the util/ subdirectory, and run `java CLI send IP PORT FILE`
     where IP is the IP of the first device, PORT is the port chosen earlier, and FILE is
     the file to send.

Finally, sending PC -> PC:
  1. On the first computer, go to the util/ subdirectory. Run `java CLI read PORT FILE`,
     where PORT is a port number (2000-60000) and FILE is the file to output to.

  2. Repeat step 2 above.
