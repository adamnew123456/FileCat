This is an attempt at an app to transfer files between an Android devices and
computers without having to configure a separate FTP server.

It includes:
  - the Android app
  - the utility (see util/README)

It is able to transfer files from:
  - Android device <-> Android device
  - computer <-> Android device
  - computer <-> computer

========== Building ==========

1. Download the Android SDK. Let `SDKDIR` be wherever
   you installed it.

2. Run `SDKDIR/tools/android update project --path .` from this directory.

3. Run `ant debug`, and copy the APK over to the device. For the first build,
   the reccomended way to do this is via FTP. The app and utility are now
   stable enough to transfer the APK of all further builds using the app 
   itself.

See util/README on how to build the utility.

========== Usage ==========

NOTE: There are 2 GUI frontends for PC's.

Using the program is simple on two Android devices:
  1. Get onto the device which is to __recieve__ the file. Choose a port number 
     (generally, 2000-60000), and an output file. Press "Recieve File" - the 
     app will print "Starting...".

  2. Then, go onto the device which is to __send__ the file. Enter the IP 
     address of the first device, the port chosen earlier, and the file to 
     send. Press "Send File" - this device should print "Starting...". When it 
     is done sending the data, the app should print "Starting... Finished".

Similarly, to go PC -> Android:
  1. Repeat step 1 above.

  2. Open the command line, go to the util/build subdirectory, and run 
     `java -jar GUI.jar`. Enter the IP address to send to, the port number selected
      in step 1 and select a file to save to. Click 'Send File' - the button should
      "stick" while sending the file.

Finally, sending PC -> PC:
  1. On the first computer, go to the util/ subdirectory, and run 
  `java -jar GUI.jar`. Enter a port number, and a file to read. Click
  `Read File`. The button should "stick" while waiting.

  2. Repeat step 2 above.
