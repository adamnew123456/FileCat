This is the utility, which comes in two parts:
  - the command line frontend
  - the Swing frontend

========== Building ==========

1. Run `ant compile`. This should automatically build what resides under `src/`
   into `build/`.

========== Using ==========

A. Change directory to `build/`, and run `java -jar GUI.jar`

B. Change directory to `build/`. To use the command line program, run:
   - `java -jar CLI.jar $IP $PORT $INPUTFILE` to send a file
   - `java -jar CLI.jar $PORT $OUTPUTFILE` to read a file
