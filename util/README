This is the utility, which comes in two parts:
  - the command line frontend
  - the Tcl/Tk GUI
  - the Python Tkinter GUI

========== Building ==========

1. Run `ant compile`

========== Using ==========

A. To use the Tcl GUI, run `wish GUI.tcl`.

C. To use the command line program, go into the build
   directory and run `java CLI`. Sending is done by
   running the command `java CLI $IP $PORT $INPUTFILE`, while
   recieving is done via `java CLI $PORT $OUTPUTFILE`.
