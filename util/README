This is the utility, which comes in three parts:
  - the command line frontend
  - the Tcl/Tk GUI
  - the Python Tkinter GUI

========== Building ==========

1. Run `ant compile`. This should automatically build what resides under `src/`
   into `build/`.

========== Using ==========

A. To use the Tcl GUI, run `wish GUI.tcl`.

B. To use the Python GUI, run `python GUI.py`.

C. Change directory to `build/`. To use the command line program, run:
   - `java CLI $IP $PORT $INPUTFILE` to send a file
   - `java CLI $PORT $OUTPUTFILE` to read a file
